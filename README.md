# SmartEnroll: Streamlined Student Registration

The Student Registration System is a web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete student records dynamically. This system ensures data persistence using Local Storage, provides input validation, and includes responsive design for usability on all devices.

## Features
  
- **Add Students**: Users can input student details (Name, Student ID, Email, Contact Number) and save them into a dynamic table.  
- **Edit Records**: Modify student details directly from the table.  
- **Delete Records**: Remove student entries from the table.  
- **Data Persistence**: Records are saved in Local Storage, ensuring data remains available even after a page refresh.  
- **Input Validation**: Validates fields to ensure:  
  - **Name** accepts only alphabetic characters.  
  - **Student ID** and **Contact Number** accept only numeric values.  
  - **Email** is in a valid format.  
  - Prevents adding empty rows.  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly for devices of different screen sizes using a mobile-first approach.  
- **Dynamic Scrollbars**: Vertical and horizontal scrollbars appear dynamically for better navigation on smaller screens.  


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.  
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness, including a mobile-first design approach.  
- **JavaScript**: Handles functionality like form validation, local storage operations, and dynamic content updates.
